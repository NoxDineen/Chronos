Howdy ho!

This is just a reminder that you will be on support tomorrow! (Insert loud cheering and enthusiastic applause.)

To get you ready for your day tomorrow, you may want to take a look at a refresher on how to take RTs, submit a feature request, etc. here. You will also be provided with a cheat sheet of phone commands tomorrow.

You will receive an email tomorrow with some helpful links that you may need.  For now, just familiarize yourself with our RT system again and get psyched for tomorrow!

Please remember that you are scheduled to be on support from 9-6. See you tomorrow!

-The Support Team!
